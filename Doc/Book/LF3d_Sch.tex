\chapter{Solving Schrodinger equation in 3D}

Currently, there are two class of methods to solve Schrodinger equation in
\texttt{ffr-LFDFT}:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Diagonalization-based method, which is implemented in subroutine \texttt{Sch\_solve\_diag}.
This is done by solving eigenproblems $H\psi=\epsilon\psi$ directly.
There are several algorithms available for doing this. Currently implemented diagonalization
methods are Davidson and LOBPCG.
\item Band-energy minimization method, which is implemented in subroutine \texttt{Sch\_solve\_Emin\_pcg}.
This is done by minimizing band energy.
