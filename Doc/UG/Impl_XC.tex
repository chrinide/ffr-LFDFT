\subsection{XC energy and potential}

Currently the only supported form of XC functional is of Volko-Wilk-Nusair
which is implemented in the file {\tt LDA\_VWN.f90}.
In the future version, LibXC implementation will be implemented hopefully.

XC contribution to total energy is implemented as follows.
\begin{fortrancode}
CALL excVWN( Npoints, Rhoe, epsxc )
E_xc = sum( Rhoe(:) * epsxc(:) )*dVol
\end{fortrancode}

\textbf{TODO}: Equation for $V_{XC}$
XC contribution to wavefunction gradient is treated the same way as
local potential.
\begin{fortrancode}
CALL excVWN( Npoints, Rhoe, epsxc )
CALL excpVWN( Npoints, Rhoe, depsxc )
V_xc(:) = epsxc(:) + Rhoe(:)*depsxc(:)
\end{fortrancode}
