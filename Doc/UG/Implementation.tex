\section{Implementation}

{\tt ffr-LFDFT} is implemented in simple Fortran language.
I used global variables heavily, as opposed to using user-defined type
to contained them. Currently, only one user-defined type is
used in {\tt ffr-LFDFT}, namely {\tt Ps\_HGH\_Params\_T}
which is mainly used for convenience.
I tried to make the code clear for those who are beginners
in implemeting a density-functional calculations (such as myself).
