\section{Introduction}

Nowadays electronic structure calculations are being used extensively in the field of
physics, chemistry, condensed matter, materials design, and drugs discovery.
Among various approaches to electronic structure, density functional theory
\cite{Hohenberg1964} is very popular one due to its good predictive
power and relatively cheap computational costs.
Using Kohn-Sham density functional theory \cite{Kohn1965} the difficult many-electrons
Schrodinger equation is mapped on to a set of single-electron equations, widely known
as Kohn-Sham equations.

To solve Kohn-Sham equations, one needs to use basis set expansions or some discretization
schemes. One choice for such basis set is Gaussian basis set which
is used in various popular computer programs such as
\textsc{Gaussian09} \cite{Gaussian2009} and GAMESS \cite{Schmidt1993,Gordon2005}.
In condensed matter community, plane wave basis set is very popular
which is used in several computer programs such as
\textsc{Quantum ESPRESSO} \cite{Giannozzi2009,Giannozzi2017}.
Instead of using specific basis set, alternatively one can discretize Kohn-Sham equations
using standard finite-difference schemes such as implemented in computer programs
such as \textsc{Octopus} \cite{Marques2003,Castro2006,Xavier2015}
and \textsc{GPAW} \cite{Enkovaara2010}.

Lagrange basis functions are a family of functions which have been
utilized for solving several differential equations in physics, which
is reviewed in a comprehensive review \cite{Baye2015}.
It uses in the context of solving Kohn-Sham equations are probably
first introduced in several publications from Tuckerman's group
\cite{HeeSeungLee2006,HeeSeungLee2006,HeeSeungLee2008}
and quite recently in several publications of Kim's group.
