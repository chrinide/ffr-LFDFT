\section{Introduction}

Nowadays electronic structure calculations are being used extensively in the field of
physics, chemistry, condensed matter, materials design, and drugs discovery.
Among various approaches to electronic structure, density functional theory
\cite{Hohenberg1964} is very popular one due to its good predictive
power and relatively cheap computational costs.
Using Kohn-Sham density functional theory \cite{Kohn1965} the difficult many-electrons
Schrodinger equation is mapped on to a set of single-electron equations, widely known
as Kohn-Sham equations.

To solve Kohn-Sham equations, one must use basis set expansions or some discretization
schemes.
