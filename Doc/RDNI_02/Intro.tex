\section{Introduction}

Nowadays electronic structure calculations are being used extensively in the field of
physics, chemistry, condensed matter, materials design, and drugs discovery.
Among various approaches to electronic structure, density functional theory
\cite{Hohenberg1964} is very popular one due to its good predictive
power and relatively cheap computational costs.
Using Kohn-Sham density functional theory \cite{Kohn1965} the difficult many-electrons
Schrodinger equation is mapped on to a set of single-electron equations, widely known
as Kohn-Sham equations.

To solve Kohn-Sham equations, one must use basis set expansions or some discretization
schemes.

One popular basis set is gaussian basis set, especially
in gas-phase chemistry. \textsc{Gaussian09}: \cite{Gaussian2009}

Plane wave basis set is very popular, especially in condensed matter
\textsc{Quantum ESPRESSO}: \cite{Giannozzi2009,Giannozzi2017}.

Real space basis set \textsc{Octopus}: \cite{Marques2003,Castro2006,Xavier2015}
GPAW: \cite{Enkovaara2010}

Lagrange mesh \cite{Baye2015}

Lagrange-sinc: \cite{Choi2015,Choi2016}

Lagrange-sinc + CI based on HF and KS: \cite{Kim2015}

Lagrange-sinc PAW \cite{Kang2016}

Tuckerman's group: \cite{HeeSeungLee2006,HeeSeungLee2006,HeeSeungLee2008}

Objective:
create implementation of total energy calculation using Lagrange basis functions
comparison to other real space

Scope: We limit our discussion to several simple forms of potential such as
gaussian and GTH local pseudopotential.
