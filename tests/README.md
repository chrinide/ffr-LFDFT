## Some termilogy

Angular momentum channels:
- s
- p
- d
- f

Each angular momentum channel may have one or more projectors.
For HGH pseudopotentials, maximum number of projectors per angular
momentum channel is 3.

- Nprj_s
- Nprj_p
- Nprj_d
- Nprj_f

Depending on the value of its AM each projector has several distinct forms

beta_{lm} = P_{l}(r) Y_{lm}(theta,phi)

for l = 0, nbeta = 1
for l = 1, nbeta = 3
for l = 2, nbeta = 5
for l = 3, nbeta = 7
